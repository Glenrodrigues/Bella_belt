# Goals

Due to CDC and NHS the main idea of stay healthy is to stay active. We can use given data to understand participants activity 
trends and then give participants (and all BellaBeat customers) evidence-based recommendations how to stay active and healthy.
Also it is well known that cardiovascular diseases are number one killer in the world. So, we can use heart rate data to analyze 
patterns in participants pulse and then give them appropriate recommendations. For example, tachycardia during rest might be a 
predictor of cardiovascular diseases.Early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease might predict myocardial infarction or stroke and save life. 
(Can BellaBeat make a new version of tracker that will also analyze blood pressure?) Some other ideas? We have participant's sleep duration data. 
Some researches shows that sleep quality and duration can impact the risks of development depression and dementia (for more information - look here
Sleep and Depression, Sleep and Dementia.. We can analyze this data and explore what customers have potential increased risk of development mentioned 
diseases and give them appropriate recommendations.
